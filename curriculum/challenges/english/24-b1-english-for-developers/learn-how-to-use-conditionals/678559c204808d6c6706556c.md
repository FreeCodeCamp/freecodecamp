# --explanation--

The correct response, `Maybe, but it's hard to know`, acknowledges the uncertainty of the situation.

- `Maybe` means `possibly` or `there's a chance`. It's used to express uncertainty or lack of full confidence.

- `Hard to know` means it's difficult to determine or make a judgment due to lack of information or clarity.

The response combines these ideas to indicate that fixing money problems is possible, but the outcome is uncertain.
