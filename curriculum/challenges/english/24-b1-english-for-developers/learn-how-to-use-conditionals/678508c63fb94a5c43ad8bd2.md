# --explanation--

The phrase `money problems` refers to financial difficulties, such as not having enough money to cover expenses or debts. For example:

- `The company is facing money problems after a drop in sales.` - This means the company is struggling financially due to fewer sales.

- `He had money problems and couldn't pay his rent on time.` - This shows personal financial difficulties.

In the audio, Lisa mentions TechCorp might have money problems, suggesting they could be struggling to stay financially stable.
