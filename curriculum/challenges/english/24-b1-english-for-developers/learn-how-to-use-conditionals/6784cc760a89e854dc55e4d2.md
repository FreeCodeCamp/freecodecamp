# --explanation--

The correct answer, `It would be a big shock`, reflects a hypothetical reaction to Lisa's imagined scenario. This matches the `Second Conditional` structure of Lisa's question, which describes an unreal or unlikely possibility.

Examples of similar responses:

- `It would cause a lot of problems.`

- `Everyone would need to find new jobs.`

These responses acknowledge the scenario and express an imagined outcome.
