# --explanation--

The phrase `be in trouble` means to face difficulties or problems. For example:

- `He's in trouble with his clients for missing the deadline.` - Facing problems because of a missed deadline.

- `If the funding stops, the project will be in trouble.` - The project would face difficulties due to a lack of funding.

In this context, small companies would encounter serious challenges if the hypothetical condition were met.
