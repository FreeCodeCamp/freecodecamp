# --explanation--

The sentence uses a `First Conditional` structure:

- `If that money goes away` (condition).

- `Those companies might not survive` (result).

This indicates that the companies' survival is uncertain and depends on whether the money is available. The word `might` adds a sense of possibility, meaning the outcome is not guaranteed.
